# Creating/Editing Documentation
Working with documentation on GitHub is very easy, once you understand how it works. Below is a quick overview of how the 
website works. More in depth information regarding editing the documentation and the **Markdown** language can be found in [the wiki.](https://github.com/UW-Whitewater-Sustainability/uw-whitewater-sustainability.github.io/wiki)

## How does it work?
[https://uw-whitewater-sustainability.github.io](https://uw-whitewater-sustainability.github.io)
is a webpage that pulls it's information from this repository. Everything on that website comes from here in one form or another.

Webpages are written in **Markdown**, a VERY simple language designed to make webpage markup a breeze. 
Markdown files are stored in a text document with a `.md` extension. Markdown is very easy to use. 
Simply create a Markdown file (e.g. `test.md`) and start typing. Everything that you write in this document 
will be translated to a webpage automatically by GitHub. 

There are X different pieces of syntax that can be used to format your page. These, along with instructions on how to edit the documentation, can be found in [the wiki.](https://github.com/UW-Whitewater-Sustainability/uw-whitewater-sustainability.github.io/wiki)
