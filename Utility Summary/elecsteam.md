# Electricity & Steam
Electricity and steam (E+S) data are formatted exactly the same, so for this section, the same steps will be used twice. Replace DOCUMENT with ELECTRICITY or STEAM respective to which data you are working on.

---

**1.)** ONLY use data from the "Meter Readings" tab.

**2.)** For electricity & steam data, you are going to want to use the "Paste - Transpose" option. This option transposes the data from a row to column, or vice versa.
