**4.)** You must now enter the equation for the $/klb. In the final column of the first row, enter the **=** sign. Then, while that cell is still being edited, click on the **B** column of that row. Enter the **/** key. Finally, click the **D** column of that row and press enter. The final equation should be “=Bx/Dx” where x is the row number.
