## Before you begin
Keep in mind that the Utility Summary records data based on the fiscal year (FY). That is, each year stars in July and ends in June. So, FY 2019 goes from July 2018 to June 2019 (Note that it starts in the year BEFORE the fiscal year).

Despite this, many of the spreadsheets start in June and end in May. 
DO NOT use June data from the same document you get the rest of your data from, use the next years document. 
For example, if you were entering FY 2019 data, you would get months July â€“ May from your 2018 document and 
you would get June data from your 2019 document. 
This is for JUNE ONLY.
